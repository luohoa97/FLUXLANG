## More info

We use GO to build our programming language currently.
If there's currently no source code on the latest branch, it is most likely that I'm still working on that release.
We currently need contributors. DM [@luohoa97](https://discord.com/users/1039999879893749821) on Discord or join [Our official discord server](https://discord.gg/qm62uARUn6) and open a ticket if you want to contribute!
